We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.\r\n\r\n- [Ghost.org](https://ghost.org)\r\n- [Latest Release](https://ghost.org/download/)\r\n- [Support](http://support.ghost.org/)\r\n- [Theme Docs](http://themes.ghost.org)\r\n- [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [Feature Requests](http://ideas.ghost.org/)\r\n- [Dev Blog](http://dev.ghost.org)\r\n\r\n**NOTE: If you’re stuck, can’t get something working or need some help, please head on over and join our [Slack community](https://ghost.org/slack/) rather than opening an issue.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Quick Start Install\r\n\r\nMake sure you've installed Node.js - We recommend the latest **Node v0.10.x** release.\r\n\r\nGhost is also compatible with **Node v0.12** and **io.js v1.2**, but please note that these versions are more likely to run into installation problems. May contain nuts. Please use the [forum](https://ghost.org/forum/installation/) for help.\r\n\r\n1. Download the [latest release](https://ghost.org/download/) of Ghost\r\n1. Unzip in the location you want to install\r\n1. Fire up a terminal\r\n1. `npm install --production`\r\n1.

Add --production\r\n```\r\n\r\nCongrats! You made it. BTW you can also just `npm install ghost` if you're into that sort of thing. NPM afficionados can also read up on using [Ghost as an NPM module](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Using-Ghost-as-an-npm-module).\r\n\r\nMore general [install docs](http://support.ghost.org/installation/) here in case you got stuck.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deploying Ghost\r\n\r\n![Ghost(Pro) + DigitalOcean](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/8180331/d6674e32-1414-11e5-8ce4-2250e9994906.png)\r\n\r\nSave yourself time and headaches with our fully managed **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** service. Deploy a new instance of Ghost in a couple of clicks running on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)’s rock solid infrastructure, with a worldwide CDN thrown in at no extra charge.\r\n\r\nAll revenue from **Ghost(Pro)** goes to the Ghost Foundation, the non-profit org which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost.\r\n\r\n[Other options](http://support.ghost.org/deploying-ghost/) are also available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Staying Up to Date\r\n\r\nWhen a new version of Ghost comes out, you'll want to look over these [upgrade instructions](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) for what to do next.\r\n\r\nYou can talk to other Ghost users on [our forums](https://ghost.org/forum) or chat with Ghost developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome). We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm London time.\r\n\r\nNew releases are announced on the [dev blog](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/). You can subscribe by email or follow [@TryGhost_Dev](https://twitter.com/tryghost_dev) on Twitter, if you prefer your updates bite-sized and facetious.\r\n\r\n:saxophone::turtle:\r\n\r\n\r\n# Copyright & License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2015 Ghost Foundation - Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
